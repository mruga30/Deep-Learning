# Problem Set 2
The code is written in MATLAB and the Data is two images created synthetically. 
Images are: 40x40 in size, all black (zeros) except a white vertical stripe or a white horizontal stripe

In this set, we differentiate between two synthetic images using a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
