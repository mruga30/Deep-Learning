# Problem Set 2
The code is written in MATLAB and Database used is http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database

In this set, we have tried to tackle the problem of the face recognition using different architectures of Artificial Neural Networks.
We train the model using 2/3rds of data and test with the remaining 1/3rd data and in doing so we successfully recognize the faces with an accuracy of around 80% with testing data and about 100% with training data.

#### hw1_3: 
**Shallow ANN Network:** Built, Trained, and Tested an ANN containing a single hidden layer from scratch.

#### hw1_4: 
**Deep ANN Network:** Built, Trained, and Tested a deep ANN from scratch. The user can built the ANN architecture of their liking where they can specify the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each layer. This helps the user to experiment and improve the accuracy of the model.  
Ex: User input: [20,30] means there are 2 hidden layers, first one with 20 nodes and the second with 30 nodes.
