# Problem Set 1
The code is written in MATLAB and Database used is http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database


In this set, we have tried to tackle the problem of the face recognition using different activation and objective functions.
We train the model using 2/3rds of data and test with the remaining 1/3rd data and in doing so we successfully recognize the faces with an accuracy of above 85% with testing data and above 95% with training data.

#### hw1_3: 
**Objective Function:** Log Likelihood  
**Activation Function:** Logistic function  

#### hw1_4: 
**Objective Function:** Cross entropy  
**Activation Function:** Softmax function
